# Semantic Tokens Disable - Performance Validation

## 🎯 **Objective**
Temporarily disable the custom semantic tokens implementation to validate whether it was causing overlapping requests and conflicts with standard LSP operations.

## 🚨 **Problem Analysis**

### **Legacy Implementation Issues:**
1. **Pre-Standard API**: Custom semantic tokens implementation was created before official LSP semantic tokens API existed
2. **Request Conflicts**: Custom `powerquery/semanticTokens` requests were interfering with standard LSP operations
3. **No Cancellation Support**: Semantic tokens handler didn't use proper cancellation token handling
4. **Overlapping Requests**: Multiple semantic token requests were bypassing the new request management system

### **Trace Evidence:**
- Multiple `powerquery/semanticTokens` requests running concurrently
- No deduplication or debouncing on semantic tokens
- Potential interference with document symbols and diagnostics operations

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **1. Server-Side Disable (`server/src/server.ts`)**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Active custom handler
connection.onRequest("powerquery/semanticTokens", async (params: SemanticTokenParams) => {
    // Custom implementation without proper cancellation/deduplication
});

// AFTER: Disabled with explanation
// TODO: TEMPORARILY DISABLED - Custom semantic tokens implementation conflicts with standard LSP operations
// This was implemented before official LSP semantic tokens API existed and needs to be rewritten
// to use the standard LSP semantic tokens provider pattern.
```

### **2. Client-Side Disable (`client/src/extension.ts`)**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Register custom provider
context.subscriptions.push(
    vscode.languages.registerDocumentSemanticTokensProvider(
        { language: "powerquery" },
        Subscriptions.createDocumentSemanticTokensProvider(client),
        Subscriptions.SemanticTokensLegend,
    ),
);

// AFTER: Disabled with explanation
// TODO: TEMPORARILY DISABLED - Custom semantic tokens implementation conflicts with standard LSP operations
```

### **3. Performance Tracking Enhancement**
**Cancellation is now treated as expected behavior, not error:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: All failures logged as errors
this.connection.console.error(`[PERF] Failed operation: ${operation}`);

// AFTER: Cancellation logged as info, failures as errors
if (isCancellation) {
    this.connection.console.log(`[PERF] Operation was cancelled: ${operation}`);
} else {
    this.connection.console.error(`[PERF] Failed operation: ${operation}`);
}
```

## 📊 **Expected Impact**

### **Reduced Request Overlapping:**
- **Eliminated**: Custom semantic token requests that bypassed request management
- **Cleaner Logs**: Fewer overlapping operation IDs in trace logs
- **Better Performance**: Reduced server load from redundant semantic token processing

### **Improved Cancellation Logging:**
- **Before**: `[Error] [PERF] Failed operation: getDocumentDiagnostics after 0.19ms`
- **After**: `[PERF] Operation was cancelled: getDocumentDiagnostics after 0.19ms`

### **Validation Focus:**
- **Document Symbols**: Test deduplication and cancellation without semantic token interference
- **Diagnostics**: Validate debouncing and performance improvements
- **Overall Responsiveness**: Assess LSP performance without legacy semantic tokens

## 🔬 **Testing Validation**

### **What to Monitor:**
1. **Reduced Overlapping Requests**: Fewer simultaneous operations in trace logs
2. **Cleaner Cancellation**: Cancellation logged as info instead of error
3. **Better Performance**: More consistent response times without semantic token conflicts
4. **Document Symbols**: Proper deduplication and sub-second response times
5. **Diagnostics**: Debounced execution and quick cancellation

### **Success Indicators:**
- ✅ **No `powerquery/semanticTokens` requests** in trace logs
- ✅ **Cancellation logged as info** (`[PERF] Operation was cancelled`)
- ✅ **Reduced request overlapping** (fewer simultaneous operations)
- ✅ **Consistent document symbol performance** (<1 second)
- ✅ **Proper diagnostic debouncing** (500ms delay during typing)

## 🚀 **Future Implementation Plan**

### **Modern Semantic Tokens Implementation:**
1. **Use Official LSP API**: Implement using `connection.languages.semanticTokens.on()`
2. **Standard Token Provider**: Follow modern LSP semantic tokens provider pattern
3. **Proper Cancellation**: Integrate with enhanced cancellation utilities
4. **Request Management**: Include deduplication and debouncing for semantic tokens
5. **Performance Tracking**: Include in modern performance monitoring system

### **Benefits of Modern Implementation:**
- **Native LSP Support**: Proper integration with VSCode's semantic highlighting
- **Better Performance**: Built-in optimizations in VSCode's semantic token handling
- **Consistent Patterns**: Same cancellation and request management as other operations
- **Future Proof**: Uses stable LSP specification instead of custom protocol

## 📝 **Files Modified**

### **Server Changes:**
- `server/src/server.ts`: Disabled custom semantic tokens handler
- Performance tracking already enhanced for proper cancellation logging

### **Client Changes:**
- `client/src/extension.ts`: Disabled custom semantic tokens provider registration

### **Compilation Status:**
- ✅ **Server Build**: Successful compilation
- ✅ **Client Build**: Successful compilation
- ✅ **No Lint Errors**: All TypeScript and linting issues resolved

---

**Summary**: Custom semantic tokens implementation has been temporarily disabled to validate core LSP performance improvements. This eliminates a major source of request conflicts and allows clean testing of the enhanced cancellation, deduplication, and performance monitoring systems. Future implementation should use the official LSP semantic tokens API for better integration and performance.
